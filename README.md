# tennisleague
Tennis league website for amateur players in Wroclaw area. 

**Description**
The idea for the Tennis League project is to allow amateur players from Wroclaw play friendly, competitive tennis.

Singles players will be divided by the administrator into several groups (depending on the number of candidates). 
Once it's done, they will have to arrange matches between them and attempt to play against each other within 7 weeks time.
All results have to be reported through the website. The main page will contain an overall ranking.

**Technologies**
