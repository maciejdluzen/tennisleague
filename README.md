Tennis league website for amateur players in Wroclaw area. 

The Web App has been deployed to Heroku cloud and is available for viewing and testing under the following url: https://wroclawskaligatenisowa.herokuapp.com
Please familiarize yourself with the app functionalities and proposed testing plan prior to entering the website.

## Introduction

The idea for the Tennis League project is to allow amateur players from Wroclaw play friendly, competitive tennis.
 
Singles players will be divided by the administrator into several groups (depending on the number of candidates). 
Once it's done, they will have to arrange matches between them and attempt to play against each other within 7 weeks time.
All results have to be reported through the website. The main page will contain an overall ranking.

Main focus has been put on building backend functionalities, however a bit of time was spent on frontend as well to make it more interesting for a potential user.

## Technologies

**Backend:** Java, Spring, Hibernate

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Bulma, JavaScript

## Current Status

In progress. Approximately 80% of work has been done to date (5th January 2020).
The app has been deployed to heroku cloud on the 5th of January 2020.

**Project completion timeline**

## Plans of the future

## Scope of functionalities

The main page (index.html) allow a potential user to:
* Read a description of the league: Click "O LIDZE" ("ABOUT THE LEAGUE"), 
* Check the ranking of a current round: Click "WYNIKI" ("RESULTS") - it shows groups with singles players ordered by number of points (ascending). It also contains the list of matches in each group, which has been played to date.
